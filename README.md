# Chrome-Extension---iSpy
A Chrome Extension iSpy game: Find the easter egg


# Chrome Extension Information

This chrome extension is simply designed as an iSpy game. When loaded into the browser and turned on, a small, slightly translucent easter egg should be hidden somewhere on the page. When the easter egg is found and clicked on, it will blow up to a bigger size and become clear to see.

# Future work

Future work on this iSpy easter egg extension includes
- [ ] make music sound when clicked
- [ ] correct code to make it so that the whole egg is always visible on the screen, because sometimes it will appear slightly off the screen.
- [ ] make it so that when clicked, the egg will grow out of the center and not off center.
- [ ] create various eggs that the extension can choose from randomly
- [ ] add code to sometimes display egg at an angle.
